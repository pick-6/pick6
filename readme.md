## Pick 6 Football Squares

Pick 6 is an application that allows users to compete with their friends on score outcomes. They purchase a square corresponding to their predicted outcome of a game, and the winner selects which charity receives the total of all the bets on that particular game. Have fun and give back to the community all at the same time!
