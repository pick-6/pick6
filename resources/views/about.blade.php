	<div class="container text-center" style="color: white">
	 People love football - including us. Fall Sundays watching the game are some of our favorite ways to spend time with friends and family. <br>
	 <br>
	 People also love giving to charity. It helps us feel closer to our communities and like we're a part of something bigger than ourselves. <br>
	 <br>
	 Built in 2017, Pick 6's goal is to combine the two. We provide a fun, positive outlet for those who enjoy sports, but also want to give back. <br>
	 <br>
	 Lastly, we are NOT a gambling site. <br>
